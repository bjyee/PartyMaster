Dear <%= @invitation.guest.name %>,

You have been uninvited to <%= @invitation.party.name %> by <%= @invitation.party.host.first_name %> <%= @invitation.party.host.last_name %>.

So why were you uninvited from this party?

Maybe you're just not this person's type (note this could mean boring, dumb, annoying, arrogant or just a general weirdo).
Maybe you suffer from bad breath, body odor, or a nasty combination of the two. 
Maybe you just give off that creepy, overbearing, psycho stalker vibe. 
Maybe the idea of doing business with you just seems as appealing as playing leap frog with unicorns. 
Regardless of the reason, please take the hint and accept the fact that you were rejected and then get over it; 
and please do your best to forget about the person who directed you this page because trust us, <%= @invitation.party.host.first_name %> <%= @invitation.party.host.last_name %> already forgotten about you.
